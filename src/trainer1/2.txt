`ls`
`pwd`
`cd`

The first command you need to know is
`ls` (list command.)

when you type `ls` on the terminal, it will list directories (folders) on your
current location.

Caution:
 Linux is case-sensitive system, so when you type the command, don't type `Ls`
 or `LS`

 Let's see what `ls` command shows.

 <type `ls` command>
