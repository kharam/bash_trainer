Now, it shows more information, we are going to learn more detail about each
folder in later training course.

Here is some list.

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root   210 Aug 22 09:41 1.txt
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root     6 Aug 22 10:06 test

'-rw-r--r--' and 'drwxr-xr-x' shows permission information and whether it is
directory or not.

If it start with 'd', then it is directory, and if it start with '-', then it
is a file.

Additionally, '210' and '6' show the file size in byte.

We have a quiz to practice.
